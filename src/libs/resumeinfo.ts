    project:
      "This project is a comprehensive web-based application designed to streamline the process of managing internship projects for students and faculty members. It allows students to submit their project proposals, receive feedback from supervisors, and track progress throughout the internship period. The platform supports real-time communication between students and advisors, including file uploads, comment threads, and project timelines. Administrators can manage user roles, monitor project statuses, and generate reports for academic evaluation. The system integrates modern technologies such as React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, ensuring a fast and responsive user experience. Additionally, the platform is optimized for mobile devices and includes notification features to keep all participants updated on deadlines and changes. Security measures such as authentication, authorization, and input validation are implemented to protect user data and project integrity. This tool greatly improves the efficiency and transparency of internship program management in educational institutions.",
